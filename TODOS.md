## 8. Pre-cached client simulation matrix

Towers have fixed hardware/antenna/height configs set by admin. The matrix varies the **client (receiver)** side — showing "what coverage does a visitor with client hardware X and antenna Y see from this tower?" Each axis of the matrix is admin-configurable: the admin enables/disables individual members per axis, and only the enabled combinations are simulated. This keeps compute time manageable while allowing full flexibility.

### Matrix axes (all toggled by admin)
- **Client hardware** — e.g., Heltec V3, Heltec V4, Custom. Admin enables which hardware options visitors can select.
- **Client antenna** — e.g., Ribbed Spring Helical, Duck Stubby, Bingfu Whip, Slinkdsco Omni. Admin enables which antennas to simulate.
- **Terrain model** — Bare-earth SRTM, DSM, LULC-burned clutter. Admin enables which terrain modes are available.
- Total simulations per tower = enabled hardware × enabled antennas × enabled terrain models (e.g., 2 × 3 × 2 = 12 instead of full 2 × 4 × 3 = 24)

### Terrain model modes
- **Bare-earth SRTM** — existing behavior, standard 1/3-arcsecond SRTM DTM tiles from AWS Open Data
- **DSM (Digital Surface Model)** — includes buildings and tree canopy as elevation; sources: USGS 3DEP (US), provincial LiDAR (Canada), Copernicus GLO-30 DSM. SPLAT! treats surface features as terrain that naturally blocks signals — no code changes to the propagation model
- **LULC-burned clutter** — SRTM bare-earth tiles with per-pixel clutter heights added from ESA WorldCover (10m, global, free). Land cover classes map to clutter heights (e.g., forest=12m, suburban=8m, urban=20m, cropland=0m, water=0m). Synthetic but global coverage with no DSM gaps

### Admin matrix configuration
- [x] Store enabled matrix members in SQLite settings table (or JSON column): `{"hardware": ["v3", "v4"], "antennas": ["bingfu_whip", "slinkdsco_omni"], "terrain": ["bare_earth", "lulc_clutter"]}`
- [x] Add admin UI panel to toggle individual members on each axis (checkboxes per hardware, antenna, terrain model)
- [x] Changing the enabled set triggers delta computation: queue only the new combinations, don't re-run existing ones
- [x] Disabling a member hides it from the visitor selector but retains cached results (can be re-enabled without re-simulating)

### Simulation & storage
- [x] Matrix varies receiver gain, sensitivity, SWR mismatch loss, and terrain model — tower TX params stay fixed
- [x] Add backend endpoint or CLI command to batch-run matrix simulations for a given tower
- [x] Store each matrix result as a separate GeoTIFF in SQLite, keyed by tower_id + client_hardware + client_antenna + terrain_model
- [x] On tower creation, auto-queue the enabled matrix combinations as background tasks
- [x] Show matrix completion progress in admin UI (e.g., "4/8" badge, polls every 5s while pending)

### Visitor UI
- [x] Add selectors for visitors to pick their client hardware + antenna + terrain model — only enabled options shown
- [x] Instantly display the matching cached coverage layer (no simulation round-trip for visitors)

## 9. Frontend performance refactors (`src/store.ts`)

- [x] Store a `GeoRasterLayer` ref on each `Site` object instead of recreating layers on every redraw
- [x] Replace `redrawSites()` remove/re-add with per-site `setOpacity()` toggling and `bringToFront()` on baselayerchange
- [x] Fix `removeSite()` double layer iteration — with per-site refs, just call `map.removeLayer(site.layer)`
- [x] Remove needless `{...site}.raster` shallow clone — pass `site.raster` directly
- [x] Wire `display.overlay_transparency` to GeoRasterLayer opacity (currently hardcoded 0.7)
- [x] Add retry cap, exponential backoff, and abort handling to `pollStatus()` loop

## 10. Backend DRY & code quality

- [x] `app/services/splat.py` — replace 4× repeated binary isfile+access validation with a loop over a dict
- [x] `app/services/splat.py` — extract shared colormap RGB helper (duplicated in `_create_splat_dcf`, `_create_splat_geotiff`, `create_splat_colorbar`)
- [x] `app/services/splat.py` — extract `_fetch_and_cache(s3_key, cache_key)` helper in `_download_terrain_tile` (V1 fallback duplicates fetch+cache block)
- [x] `app/services/splat.py` — add `from e` exception chaining to all re-raises (currently drops tracebacks)
- [x] `app/services/splat.py` — migrate `os.path` usage to `pathlib.Path` per CLAUDE.md code standards
- [x] `app/main.py` — make `get_db()` a context manager to eliminate 5× repeated `conn = get_db() / try / finally: conn.close()` boilerplate
- [x] `app/db/schema.py` — have `init_db()` use `get_db()` instead of opening its own raw connection (duplicates PRAGMA setup)
- [x] `pyproject.toml` — `haversine` is listed as a dependency but never imported (already removed)

## 11. Per-tower color rendering & overlap hatching

Each tower gets a user-assigned color. Coverage is rendered as that solid color with transparency proportional to signal strength. Transparency maps to reception quality: **10% transparency (nearly opaque) = minimum signal threshold** (barely receivable by the selected client device), **80% transparency (nearly invisible) = perfect reception**. This means strong-signal areas fade out while weak-signal edges are prominently visible — highlighting the coverage boundary, which is the most useful information for placement decisions.

Where multiple towers overlap, the area uses cross-hatched line shading — each tower's lines drawn in its color, with line thickness proportional to that tower's signal strength (stronger signal = thicker lines).

### Phase 1 — Per-tower solid color rendering
- [x] Add `color` field to towers table (hex string, e.g., "#ff0000") and Site/SplatParams types
- [x] Add color picker to tower creation form (admin), cycling through a 24-color palette: all permutations of `{0, 128, 255}` on R, G, B excluding greyscale `(0,0,0)`, `(128,128,128)`, `(255,255,255)`
- [x] Replace matplotlib colormap rendering with single-color + alpha: use `pixelValuesToColorFn` on GeoRasterLayer to map dBm → alpha on the tower's color
- [x] Alpha mapping: 10% transparency (alpha ≈ 230) at `signal_threshold` (minimum receivable), linearly scaling to 80% transparency (alpha ≈ 51) at max dBm (perfect reception). Pixels below threshold get alpha 0 (fully transparent / no coverage).
- [x] Backend: generate "raw dBm" GeoTIFFs (reverse-map PPM colors to dBm via DCF LUT)
- [x] Store raw dBm GeoTIFFs — colormap is now a frontend concern, not baked into the raster

### Phase 2 — Overlap detection & hatched rendering
- [x] Create a custom Leaflet canvas layer (`OverlapHatchLayer`) that composites all visible tower rasters
- [x] For each pixel, determine which towers have coverage (signal above threshold)
- [x] Single-tower pixel → solid color + alpha based on signal strength (same 10%–80% transparency scale)
- [x] Multi-tower pixel → draw diagonal stripes per tower, each in that tower's color
- [x] Line thickness scales with signal strength relative to other towers at that pixel (stronger = thicker lines)
- [x] Each tower gets a unique stripe angle (e.g., tower A = 45°, tower B = 135°) for natural cross-hatching
- [x] Toggle between "hatched overlap" and "simple alpha blend" modes in display settings

## 12. Deadzone remediation suggestion layer

Toggleable overlay that analyzes gaps in the combined coverage of all towers and highlights deadzones. Rendered as a **white dotted pattern** with transparency proportional to deadzone severity: areas with zero coverage from any tower are **80% opaque** (strong white dots), areas with weak partial coverage fade toward fully transparent. Requires at least 2 existing towers with completed simulations.

### Analysis
- [x] Compute a "coverage gap" raster from all active tower simulations: for each pixel, record the best signal from any tower (or no-coverage if below threshold everywhere)
- [x] Identify contiguous deadzone regions (connected components of no-coverage pixels within the simulation extent)
- [x] Score each deadzone by area and proximity to existing coverage edges — large gaps adjacent to near-threshold signal are highest priority (a new tower there extends the network most efficiently)
- [x] Filter out deadzones that are too small (noise) or too far from any existing coverage (unreachable by a single new tower)

### Rendering
- [x] Render deadzones as white dotted/stippled pattern on a canvas overlay layer
- [x] Transparency scales with deadzone severity: complete deadzone (no signal from any tower) = 80% opaque white dots (alpha ≈ 204), near-threshold weak signal = nearly transparent, above-threshold coverage = fully transparent (no dots)
- [x] Dot density or size can optionally scale with severity for additional visual weight in the worst gaps

### Suggestion markers
- [x] For candidate points within or adjacent to deadzones, estimate how much deadzone area a new tower at that point would cover (based on terrain LOS from that point, using a simplified or cached SPLAT! model)
- [x] Show top-N suggested sites as numbered markers with estimated coverage gain (e.g., "~12 km² new coverage")

### UI
- [x] Add toggle in display settings: "Show deadzone remediation" (disabled until ≥2 towers exist)
- [x] Clicking a suggestion marker opens a popup with: estimated new coverage area, terrain summary, option to pre-fill the transmitter form with that location's coordinates
- [x] Recompute suggestions when towers are added, removed, or simulations complete

## 13. Multi-source terrain data pipeline

Support three terrain elevation sources that feed into SPLAT! via the existing tile preprocessing step (`_convert_hgt_to_sdf`). SPLAT! itself doesn't change — it always reads `.sdf` tiles. The difference is what elevation values those tiles contain.

### Bare-earth SRTM (existing)
- [x] Download 1-arcsecond SRTM `.hgt.gz` tiles from AWS `elevation-tiles-prod`
- [x] Downsample to 3-arcsecond for standard resolution mode
- [x] Convert to SPLAT! `.sdf` via `srtm2sdf`

### DSM (Digital Surface Model)
- [x] Add DSM tile source support: Copernicus GLO-30 DSM (global 30m, free via AWS/OpenData)
- [x] DSM tiles include buildings and tree canopy as elevation — SPLAT! treats them as terrain that blocks signals
- [x] Implement DSM tile downloader with same cache pattern as SRTM (`diskcache` keyed by `dsm:{tile_name}`)
- [x] Fall back to bare-earth SRTM for tiles where DSM data is unavailable
- [x] Convert DSM `.hgt` to `.sdf` using same `srtm2sdf` pipeline

### LULC-burned clutter
- [x] Download ESA WorldCover tiles (10m GeoTIFF, global, free) — classify each pixel as tree cover, shrubland, grassland, cropland, built-up, bare/sparse, water, wetland, etc.
- [x] Define clutter height lookup table per land cover class (e.g., tree cover=12m, built-up=20m, shrubland=3m, cropland=0m, water=0m)
- [x] In tile preprocessing: load SRTM bare-earth tile + co-located WorldCover tile, resample WorldCover to match SRTM grid, add per-pixel clutter height to elevation values
- [x] Cache the burned tiles separately (`lulc:{tile_name}`) so bare-earth originals remain available
- [x] Convert burned `.hgt` to `.sdf` using same `srtm2sdf` pipeline

### Weighted Aggregate mode
A fourth virtual terrain model that blends the three real models into a single composite prediction. No additional SPLAT! run — it's a weighted pixel-level blend of the three existing simulation results.

- [x] For each pixel, compute: `signal_dBm = 0.20 × bare_earth + 0.40 × DSM + 0.40 × LULC_clutter`
- [x] Requires all three base terrain simulations to be completed for the tower+client combination; skip pixels where any source has no data
- [x] Generate the aggregate as a derived GeoTIFF (or compute on-the-fly in the frontend `pixelValuesToColorFn` if all three rasters are loaded)
- [x] Rationale: bare-earth is optimistic (no obstructions), DSM and LULC each capture different real-world blockage — weighting them equally at 40% each gives a practical "expected real-world" estimate while the 20% bare-earth component prevents over-pessimism in areas where DSM/LULC data is noisy
- [x] Add `"weighted_aggregate"` as a terrain model option in the visitor UI selector (only available when all three base models are cached)

### Terrain model selection
- [x] Add `terrain_model` field to `CoveragePredictionRequest`: `"bare_earth"` (default), `"dsm"`, `"lulc_clutter"`
- [x] Route tile download/preprocessing through the selected model in `coverage_prediction()`
- [x] Store terrain model used alongside each simulation result in SQLite (simulations table has terrain_model column)
- [x] `"weighted_aggregate"` is computed from cached results, not a separate SPLAT! run

## 14. Meshcore tower path simulation

- [x] Add SPLAT! point-to-point analysis function in `app/services/splat.py`
- [x] Add `POST /tower-paths` endpoint that runs pairwise P2P between selected towers
- [x] Store path results (path loss, LOS status) in SQLite `tower_paths` table
- [x] Add `GET /tower-paths` endpoint returning all computed paths
- [x] Render paths as Leaflet polylines between tower markers (color-coded by path quality)
- [x] Add toggle to show/hide mesh path overlay independently from coverage layers
- [x] Recalculate affected paths when a tower is added or removed

## 15. Backend audit — API conventions, DRY, dead code

### API convention violations
- [x] `POST /predict` returns 200 — should return 201 Created (resource creation)
- [x] `POST /tower-paths` returns 200 — should return 202 Accepted (queues background work)
- [x] `PUT /matrix/config` accepts `dict[str, Any]` — should use a Pydantic model like all other mutation endpoints
- [x] `/simulations/{tower_id}/aggregate` collides with `/simulations/{sim_id}/result` — move aggregate to `/towers/{tower_id}/aggregate`

### DRY violations
- [x] `get_result` and `get_simulation_result` duplicate GeoTIFF-or-status streaming logic — extract shared helper
- [x] `delete_tower` and `delete_tower_path` duplicate delete-check-rowcount-404 pattern — extract helper
- [x] Background task error handling in `run_splat` and `run_matrix_simulations` duplicates try/update-db/except/update-error pattern — extract helper

### Dead code
- [x] `Splat.bucket_name` and `Splat.bucket_prefix` stored on instance but unused after terrain provider extraction — remove

## 16. Mobile / responsive design

### Critical
- [x] Add responsive breakpoints to all form columns (`col-12 col-sm-6` instead of fixed `col-6`) across Transmitter, Receiver, Environment, Simulation, Display, ClientSelector components
- [x] Remove hardcoded `width: 38px; height: 31px` from color picker in Transmitter.vue — let Bootstrap handle sizing
- [x] Make colorbar image responsive in Display.vue (`max-width: 100%; height: auto` instead of fixed `width="256" height="30"`)

### Medium
- [x] Add responsive stacking to TowerList items — tower name + buttons wrap on narrow screens via `flex-wrap` + `gap-1`
- [x] Add mobile-specific row spacing via `@media (max-width: 575.98px)` rule in style.css
- [x] Increase antenna mismatch loss badge font size on mobile (`max(0.75rem, 12px)` floor)

### Minor
- [x] Prevent navbar brand text + buttons from overflowing on very narrow viewports — `text-truncate` on brand, `flex-shrink-0` on buttons, max-width constraint
- [x] Add mobile-specific CSS rules in style.css for offcanvas sidebar max-height and overflow on small screens

### Round 2 — Critical
- [x] Fix dropdown menus clipped inside offcanvas on mobile — `position: static` + no transform on mobile
- [x] Fix map hidden under fixed navbar — `margin-top: 56px` and `height: calc(100vh - 56px)`
- [x] Fix offcanvas covering entire map on phones — 60vh max-height with scroll

### Round 2 — Medium
- [x] Increase touch targets on TowerList eye/trash buttons — `py-1 px-2` with `min-width/min-height: 36px`
- [x] Fix MatrixConfig inline checkboxes overflow on mobile — `form-check-inline` becomes `display: block` on <576px
- [x] Improve deadzone stats text wrapping in Display.vue — `<br class="d-sm-none">` line breaks on mobile only

### Round 2 — Minor
- [x] Fix "Set with Map" popover placement on mobile — changed to `data-bs-placement="auto"`
- [x] Increase tower color circle size in TowerList — 10px → 12px
- [x] Fix suggestion marker popup width on small screens — `min-width: 200px` → `max-width: min(200px, 80vw)`
- [x] Add landscape-specific media query to reduce offcanvas height on landscape phones

### Round 3 — Medium
- [x] Remove hardcoded `<br />` in Environment.vue "Clutter Height" label — use natural text flow
- [x] Stack "Set with Map" / "Center map on transmitter" buttons vertically on mobile — `flex-column flex-sm-row`
- [x] Make "Run Simulation" button sticky at bottom of offcanvas — `sticky-bottom bg-dark`
- [x] Add `flex-shrink-0` to antenna mismatch loss badge to prevent compression on narrow widths

### Round 3 — Minor
- [x] Increase offcanvas close button touch target for mobile — added `p-3` padding
